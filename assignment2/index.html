<p>Reincarnation  TW: Death</p>

<p>Players: 1-5 </p>
<p>Time: 30-40 minutes</p>

<p>Write your full name on a piece of paper. Describe how you would die if you were to die soon, go into as much detail as you are comfortable with. As you do so, crumple the piece of paper until it forms a ball. Recount your life starting from your death and going backwards, highlighting moments in your life that are of great importance to making you who you are. When you are done recounting your life, have everyone else do the same. </p>
<p>Once you are done recounting your lives, uncrumple the piece of paper and write down an imaginary name that resonates with you. Starting from that person's birth, tell the story of their life, highlighting important events in their life until you describe their ultimate death; crumpling the paper in turn when they die. When you are done recounting that person's life, have everyone else do the same.</p>
<p>Using any materials you want, draw, tear, and shape the paper until you are satisfied with how the creation is. Admire the creations that you have all made together and reflect on the two lives that have helped create this single creation.</p>
